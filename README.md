# GGJ2020
Global Game Jam 2020 Boys

## Setup Instructions
We are using Typescript with webpack. You must have a server running to view the game, phaser does not transfer files over a file based webpage.

## 1) Checkout source
Clone the repo to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/mcouture5/GGJ2020.git`

## 1) Install dependencies
`npm install` in the main folder.

## 2) Run a python webserver
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within the main folder.

## 3) Run dev build
The dev webpack build will auto build whenever changes are made. No need to rebuild and crap.

`npm run dev`

## 4) Profit
Visit localhost:8000 to see the game
