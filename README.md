# GGJ2021

## Setup Instructions
We are using Typescript with webpack. You must have a server running to view the game, phaser does not transfer files over a file based webpage.

Clone the repo to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/mvandani/GGJ2021.git`

## 1) Install dependencies
`npm install` in the main folder.

## 2) Run a python webserver
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within the main folder.

## 3) Run dev build
The dev webpack build will auto build whenever changes are made. No need to rebuild and crap.
